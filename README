The repository is my typical git configuration on cygwin.

To use do the following (inside the gitfiles working directory):
1.  Link your working .gitconfig to the .gitconfig in the repository
    > ln .gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
2.  Install BeyondCompare (I use this as my difftool/merge tool).
    Note, if you install BeyondCompare in a location other than
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Beyond Compare 3
    then you will need to change the "beyondcompare" variable
    in githelperfunctions.sh
